# Exercise 8: we will make a function to find the biggest number in a list by using builtin functions

# we will be using the builtin functon called max which finds the biggest number in a list
# you can use it like any other function, u call it and add a list as parameter eg  max(list)
def find_max(numbers):
     #all your coding is to be done inside the function greet()


# do not add another function here. you may change the input inside if you wish
print(find_max([1, 5, 3, 9, 2]))  # Should print 9
