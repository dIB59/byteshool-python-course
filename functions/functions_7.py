# Exercise 7: here we will be making two functions, where one calls the other

#this functions just prints hello world
def greet():
     #all your coding is to be done inside the function greet()


#this function first calls the greet function, then it prints my name is (whatever the name of the user is)
def greet_name(name):
         #all your coding is to be done inside the function greet()



# do not add another function here. you may change the name input inside if you wish
greet_name("Alice")
